    • Couldn't match type: as ++ (bs ++ cs)
                     with: (as ++ bs) ++ cs
      Expected: proxy ((as ++ bs) ++ cs)
        Actual: proxy (as ++ (bs ++ cs))
      NB: ‘++’ is a non-injective type family
    • In the expression: r
      In an equation for ‘ex2e’: ex2e _ _ _ r = r
    • Relevant bindings include
